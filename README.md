# Advent of Code 2020

Solutions to the Advent of Code 2020.

The goals here are, in no particular order:
- Try out [Wave](https://www.h2o.ai/products/h2o-wave/) on a substantial problem set
- See if I can complete the whole thing with [MiniZinc](https://www.minizinc.org/) skills
- Practice working out of [Development Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)
- Brush up on Docker
- Promote MiniZinc and give newcomers some tangible examples to reference
- Have fun!
